1) Create the ansible vault file (you can call it anything. Here, I'm calling it 'extra_vars'):
     ansible-vault create extra_vars
    
     Set your vault password, and put in the following-
      # if become (sudo) password
      ansible_become_pass : <password>

      # if regular ssh password
      ansible_ssh_pass : <password>

      Save the file. This is an encrypted file so you cannot vi into it. You can do the following:
      #view
       ansible-vault view extra_vars
   
      #edit
       ansible-vault edit extra_vars


2) Write the playbook (lets call it host.yaml):

    - hosts: host1.example.com

      vars_files:
                    - extra_vars

      tasks:
                    - name: Run ls on /root
                      shell: ls /root
                      register: ls

                    - debug: var=ls.stdout_lines


3) Run the playbook as follows:

    ansible-playbook mta.yaml --ask-vault-pass

    Supply the vault password you set earlier. Your playbook should run successfully.
    If you prefer the slightly lazy (insecure) way, you can put that vault password into a file and call it like this:

    ansible-playbook mta.yaml --vault-password-file=vault.txt

    The password should be a string stored as a single line in the file
